seconds-calc
============

Calculates total seconds from hours, minutes, and seconds

Description
===========
A down and dirty calculator that converts hours, minutes, and seconds to seconds. I created this to use as a testing tool for my payroll-login project found here:
https://github.com/thadseaver/payroll-login.git
It's not meant to be pretty but it does the job.
